        <p>My name is Chudue Herr. I was born on July 25th 1995 in Milwaukee Wisconsin. I have a total of 6 sibilings, 1 brother and 5 sisters. Me and my siblings grew up in a neighborhood that wasn’t too good, but that didn’t stop us from going outside to play with family and friends. I enjoy fixing cars and spending time with my friends and family. Growing up, I always wanted to become a successful person by having my own business. </p>
        <p>My very first job was at an auto repair shop called Midas. My position there was a lube techenician. A lube techenician is someone who does oil change, tire repair/replacemant and maintenance on vechiles. When I first started this job, I didn’t know anything about cars, therefore I had to learn everything by myself and work my way up to become an auto techenician. With all the learning and hard work at Midas, I eventually became an auto tech. Once I became a tech, I decided to leave Midas to go work at a dealership so that I can gain more experience in the automotive field.</p>
        <p>As the years passed, I realized that for me to become successful I needed to go back to school and continue my education. Working as an auto techenician, I was aware of that working on cars wasn’t what I wanted to do for the rest of my life, therefore I was determined to take a turn in my career path. I decided that I wanted to become a software developer.</p>
